when i was little i thought my country was the best on the planet and i grew up singing a song called nothing to envy
and i was very proud
in school we spent a lot of time studying the history of kim il sung but we never learned much about the outside world except that america south korea japan are the enemies
although i often wondered about the outside world i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea until everything suddenly changed
when i was seven years old i saw my first public execution but i thought my life in north korea was normal
my family was not poor and myself i had never experienced hunger
but one day in my mom brought home a letter from a coworker s sister
it read when you read this all five family members will not exist in this world because we haven t eaten for the past two weeks
we are lying on the floor together and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die
i was so shocked
this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering
soon after when i was walking past a train station i saw something terrible that i can t erase from my memory
a lifeless woman was lying on the ground while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother s face
but nobody helped them because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families
a huge famine hit north korea in the mid s
ultimately more than a million north koreans died during the famine and many only survived by eating grass bugs and tree bark
power outages also became more and more frequent so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in china just across the river from my home
i always wondered why they had lights but we didn t
this is a satellite picture showing north korea at night compared to neighbors
this is the amrok river which serves as a part of the border between north korea and china
as you can see the river can be very narrow at certain points allowing north koreans to secretly cross
but many die
sometimes i saw dead bodies floating down the river
i can t reveal many details about how i left north korea but i only can say that during the ugly years of the famine i was sent to china to live with distant relatives
but i only thought that i would be separated from my family for a short time
i could have never imagined that it would take years to live together
in china it was hard living as a young girl without my family
i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean refugee but i soon learned it s not only extremely difficult it s also very dangerous since north korean refugees are considered in china as illegal migrants
so i was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed and i would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in north korea
one day my worst nightmare came true when i was caught by the chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation
someone had accused me of being north korean so they tested my chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions
i was so scared i thought my heart was going to explode
if anything seemed unnatural i could be imprisoned and repatriated
i thought my life was over but i managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions
after they finished questioning me one official said to another this was a false report
she s not north korean
and they let me go it was a miracle
some north koreans in china seek asylum in foreign embassies but many can be caught by the chinese police and repatriated
these girls were so lucky
even though they were caught they were eventually released after heavy international pressure
these north koreans were not so lucky
every year countless north koreans are caught in china and repatriated to north korea where they can be tortured imprisoned or publicly executed
even though i was really fortunate to get out many other north koreans have not been so lucky
it s tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive
even after learning a new language and getting a job their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant
that s why after years of hiding my identity i decided to risk going to south korea and i started a new life yet again
settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected
english was so important in south korea so i had to start learning my third language
also i realized there was a wide gap between north and south
we are all korean but inside we have become very different due to years of division
i even went through an identity crisis
am i south korean or north korean
where am i from who am i
suddenly there was no country i could proudly call my own
even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy i made a plan
i started studying for the university entrance exam
just as i was starting to get used to my new life i received a shocking phone call
the north korean authorities intercepted some money that i sent to my family and as a punishment my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside
they had to get out quickly so i started planning how to help them escape
north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom
it s almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south korea so ironically i took a flight back to china and i headed toward the north korean border
since my family couldn t speak chinese i had to guide them somehow through more than miles in china and then into southeast asia
the journey by bus took one week and we were almost caught several times
one time our bus was stopped and boarded by a chinese police officer
he took everyone s i d cards and he started asking them questions
since my family couldn t understand chinese i thought my family was going to be arrested
as the chinese officer approached my family i impulsively stood up and i told him that these are deaf and dumb people that i was chaperoning
he looked at me suspiciously but luckily he believed me
we made it all the way to the border of laos but i had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in laos
but even after we got past the border my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing
after i paid the fine and bribe my family was released in one month but soon after my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of laos
this was one of the lowest points in my life
i did everything to get my family to freedom and we came so close but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the south korean embassy
i went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station desperately trying to get my family out but i didn t have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore
i lost all hope
at that moment i heard one man s voice ask me what s wrong
i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask
in my broken english and with a dictionary i explained the situation and without hesitating the man went to the atm and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail
i thanked him with all my heart and i asked him why are you helping me
i m not helping you he said
i m helping the north korean people
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life
the kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the north korean people when we needed it most and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we north korean people need
eventually after our long journey my family and i were reunited in south korea but getting to freedom is only half the battle
many north koreans are separated from their families and when they arrive in a new country they start with little or no money
so we can benefit from the international community for education english language training job training and more
we can also act as a bridge between the people inside north korea and the outside world because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside and we send information and money that is helping to change north korea from inside
i ve been so lucky received so much help and inspiration in my life so i want to help give aspiring north koreans a chance to prosper with international support
i m confident that you will see more and more north koreans succeeding all over the world including the ted stage
thank you
today i have just one request
please don t tell me i m normal
now i d like to introduce you to my brothers
remi is tall and very handsome
he s speechless but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot
remi knows what love is
he shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless
he s not greedy he doesn t see skin color
he doesn t care about religious differences and get this he has never told a lie
when he sings songs from our childhood attempting words that not even i could remember he reminds me of one thing how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be
samuel is he s tall he s very handsome
he has the most impeccable memory
he has a selective one though
he doesn t remember if he stole my chocolate bar but he remembers the year of release for every song on my ipod conversations we had when he was four weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of teletubbies and lady gaga s birthday
don t they sound incredible
but most people don t agree
and in fact because their minds don t fit into society s version of normal they re often bypassed and misunderstood
but what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case although they were not seen as ordinary this could only mean one thing that they were extraordinary autistic and extraordinary
now for you who may be less familiar with the term autism it s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication learning and sometimes physical skills
it manifests in each individual differently hence why remi is so different from sam
and across the world every minutes one new person is diagnosed with autism and although it s one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world there is no known because or cure
and i cannot remember the first moment i encountered autism but i cannot recall a day without it
i was just three years old when my brother came along and i was so excited that i had a new being in my life
and after a few months went by i realized that he was different
he screamed a lot
he didn t want to play like the other babies did and in fact he didn t seem very interested in me whatsoever
remi lived and reigned in his own world with his own rules and he found pleasure in the smallest things like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between
and as he grew older he grew more different and the differences became more obvious
yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never ending hyperactivity was something really unique a pure and innocent nature a boy who saw the world without prejudice a human who had never lied
extraordinary
now i cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family moments where i ve wished that they were just like me
but i cast my mind back to the things that they ve taught me about individuality and communication and love and i realize that these are things that i wouldn t want to change with normality
normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us and the fact that we are different doesn t mean that one of us is wrong
it just means that there s a different kind of right
and if i could communicate just one thing to remi and to sam and to you it would be that you don t have to be normal
you can be extraordinary
because autistic or not the differences that we have we ve got a gift everyone s got a gift inside of us and in all honesty the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential
the chance for greatness for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else
please don t tell me i m normal
thank you
you probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road
it s made of asphalt and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on but not always especially not on these days as today when it s raining a lot
then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt
and especially if you then ride with your bicycle and pass these cars then that s not very nice
also asphalt can create a lot of noise
it s a noisy material and if we produce roads like in the netherlands very close to cities then we would like a silent road
the solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt
porous asphalt a material that we use now in most of the highways in the netherlands it has pores and water can just rain through it so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides and you have a road that s easy to drive on so no splash water anymore
also the noise will disappear in these pores
because it s very hollow all the noise will disappear so it s a very silent road
it also has disadvantages of course and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur
what is raveling you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off
first you get one stone then several more and more and more and more and more and then they well i will not do that
but they can damage your windshield so you re not happy with that
and finally this raveling can also lead to more and more damage
sometimes you can create potholes with that
ha he s ready
potholes of course that can become a problem but we have a solution
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material
it s a porous asphalt like i said so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones
due to weathering due to you v light due to oxidation this binder this bitumen the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink and if it shrinks it gets micro cracks and it delaminates from the aggregates
then if you drive over the road you take out the aggregates what we just saw here
to solve this problem we thought of self healing materials
if we can make this material self healing then probably we have a solution
so what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen
so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it
then you need a machine like you see here that you can use for cooking an induction machine
induction can heat especially steel it s very good at that
then what you do is you heat up the steel you melt the bitumen and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks and the stones are again fixed to the surface
today i use a microwave because i cannot take the big induction machine here onstage
so a microwave is a similar system
so i put the specimen in which i m now going to take out to see what happened
so this is the specimen coming out now
so i said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens
we tested a lot of specimens there and then the government they actually saw our results and they thought well that s very interesting we have to try that
so they donated to us a piece of highway meters of the a where we had to make a test track to test this material
so that s what we did here you see where we were making the test road and then of course this road will last several years without any damage that s what we know from practice
so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab
so we did aging on the samples did a lot of loading on it healed them with our induction machine and healed them and tested them again
several times we can repeat that
so actually the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine this is the big version we have made to go on the real road if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road which of course saves a lot of money
well to conclude i can say that we made a material using steel fibers the addition of steel fibers using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road double the surface life you can even do so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks
and now you re of course curious if it also worked
so we still have the specimen here it s quite warm
actually it still has to cool down first before i can show you that the healing works
but i will do a trial
let s see yeah it worked
thank you
i m here today to talk about a disturbing question which has an equally disturbing answer
my topic is the secrets of domestic violence and the question i m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks why does she stay
why would anyone stay with a man who beats her
i m not a psychiatrist a social worker or an expert in domestic violence
i m just one woman with a story to tell
i was i had just graduated from harvard college
i had moved to new york city for my first job as a writer and editor at seventeen magazine
i had my first apartment my first little green american express card and i had a very big secret
my secret was that i had this gun loaded with hollow point bullets pointed at my head by the man who i thought was my soulmate many many times
the man who i loved more than anybody on earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than i can even remember
i m here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year
it may even be your story
i don t look like a typical domestic violence survivor
i have a b a in english from harvard college an mba in marketing from wharton business school
i ve spent most of my career working for fortune companies including johnson amp amp johnson leo burnett and the washington post
i ve been married for almost years to my second husband and we have three kids together
my dog is a black lab and i drive a honda odyssey minivan
so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone all races all religions all income and education levels
it s everywhere
and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women that it s a women s issue
not exactly
over percent of abusers are men and domestic abuse happens only in intimate interdependent long term relationships in other words in families the last place we would want or expect to find violence which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing
i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me but in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age
i was and in the united states women ages to are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages and over women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners boyfriends and husbands in the united states
i was also a very typical victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence its warning signs or its patterns
i met conor on a cold rainy january night
he sat next to me on the new york city subway and he started chatting me up
he told me two things
one was that he too had just graduated from an ivy league school and that he worked at a very impressive wall street bank
but what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy
he had these big cheeks these big apple cheeks and this wheat blond hair and he seemed so sweet
one of the smartest things conor did from the very beginning was to create the illusion that i was the dominant partner in the relationship
he did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me
we started dating and he loved everything about me that i was smart that i d gone to harvard that i was passionate about helping teenage girls and my job
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams
conor believed in me as a writer and a woman in a way that no one else ever had
and he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret which was that as a very young boy starting at age four he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade even though he was very smart and he d spent almost years rebuilding his life
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him
if you had told me that this smart funny sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup how short my skirts were where i lived what jobs i took who my friends were and where i spent christmas i would have laughed at you because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor at the beginning
i didn t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim
i also didn t know that the second step is to isolate the victim
now conor did not come home one day and announce you know hey all this romeo and juliet stuff has been great but i need to move into the next phase where i isolate you and i abuse you — — so i need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises
instead conor came home one friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day his dream job and he said that he had quit his job because of me because i had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn t need to prove himself on wall street anymore and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive dysfunctional family and move to a tiny town in new england where he could start his life over with me by his side
now the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york and my dream job but i thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate so i agreed and i quit my job and conor and i left manhattan together
i had no idea i was falling into crazy love that i was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical financial and psychological trap
the next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts
and here s where those guns come in
as soon as we moved to new england you know that place where connor was supposed to feel so safe he bought three guns
he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
he kept one under the pillows on our bed and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times
and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he d experienced as a young boy
he needed them to feel protected
but those guns were really a message for me and even though he hadn t raised a hand to me my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day
conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding
it was a m i still had on my nightgown
i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment and i got frustrated and conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall
five days later the ten bruises on my neck had just faded and i put on my mother s wedding dress and i married him
despite what had happened i was sure we were going to live happily ever after because i loved him and he loved me so much
and he was very very sorry
he had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me
it was an isolated incident and he was never going to hurt me again
it happened twice more on the honeymoon
the first time i was driving to find a secret beach and i got lost and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver s side window
and then a few days later driving home from our honeymoon he got frustrated by traffic and he threw a cold big mac in my face
conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage
i was mistaken in thinking that i was unique and alone in this situation
one in three american women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life and the cdc reports that million children are abused every year million
so actually i was in very good company
back to my question why did i stay
the answer is easy
i didn t know he was abusing me
even though he held those loaded guns to my head pushed me down stairs threatened to kill our dog pulled the key out of the car ignition as i drove down the highway poured coffee grinds on my head as i dressed for a job interview i never once thought of myself as a battered wife
instead i was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man and i was the only person on earth who could help conor face his demons
the other question everybody asks is why doesn t she just leave
why didn t i walk out i could have left any time
to me this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask because we victims know something you usually don t it s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser
because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her
over percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship after she s gotten out because then the abuser has nothing left to lose
other outcomes include long term stalking even after the abuser remarries denial of financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother
and still we ask why doesn t she just leave
i was able to leave because of one final sadistic beating that broke through my denial
i realized that the man who i loved so much was going to kill me if i let him
so i broke the silence
i told everyone the police my neighbors my friends and family total strangers and i m here today because you all helped me
we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines self destructive women damaged goods
the question why does she stay
is code for some people for it s her fault for staying as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us
but since publishing crazy love i have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened and who rebuilt lives joyous happy lives as employees wives and mothers lives completely free of violence like me
because it turns out that i m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor
i remarried a kind and gentle man and we have those three kids
i have that black lab and i have that minivan
what i will never have again ever is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me
right now maybe you re thinking wow this is fascinating or wow how stupid was she but this whole time i ve actually been talking about you
i promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves
abuse could be affecting your daughter your sister your best friend right now
i was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence
i m still breaking the silence today
it s my way of helping other victims and it s my final request of you
talk about what you heard here
abuse thrives only in silence
you have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it
we victims need everyone
we need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and family
recast survivors as wonderful lovable people with full futures
recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene deescalate it show victims a safe way out
together we can make our beds our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be
thank you
i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals
there are species of birds in the world
vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds
when you see a vulture like this the first thing that comes to your mind is these are disgusting ugly greedy creatures that are just after your flesh associated with politicians
i want to change that perception i want to change those feelings you have for these birds because they need our sympathy they really do
and i ll tell you why
first of all why do they have such a bad press
when charles darwin went across the atlantic in on the beagle he saw the turkey vulture and he said these are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity
you could not get a worse insult and that from charles darwin
you know he changed his mind when he came back and i ll tell you why
they ve also be associated with disney — — personified as goofy dumb stupid characters
more recently if you ve been following the kenyan press — — these are the attributes that they associated the kenyan mps with but i want to challenge that
i want to challenge that do you know why
because mps do not keep the environment clean
mps do not help to prevent the spread of diseases
they are hardly monogamous
they are far from being extinct
and my favorite is vultures are better looking
so there s two types of vultures in this planet
there are the new world vultures that are mainly found in the americas like the condors and the caracaras and then the old world vultures where we have species from these of them are facing a high risk of extinction
so why are vultures important first of all they provide vital ecological services they clean up
they re our natural garbage collectors
they clean up carcasses right to the bone
they help to kill all the bacteria they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and because huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases
vultures also have tremendous historical significance
they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture
nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood and together with the cobra symbolized the unity between upper and lower egypt
in hindu mythology jatayu was the vulture god and he risked his life in order to save the goddess sita from the headed demon ravana
in tibetan culture they are performing very important sky burials in places like tibet there are no places to bury the dead or wood to cremate them so these vultures provide a natural disposal system
so what is the problem with vultures
we have eight species of vultures that occur in kenya of which six are highly threatened with extinction
the reason is that they re getting poisoned and the reason that they re getting poisoned is because there s human wildlife conflicts the pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators and in return the vultures are falling victim to this
in south asia in countries like india and pakistan four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered which means they have less than or years to go extinct and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like diclofenac
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india and they have taken a stand
because there are no vultures there s been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites and when you have feral dogs you have a huge time bomb of rabies the number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in india
kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in africa wind turbines are going to be up at lake turkana
i am not against wind energy but we need to work with the governments because wind turbines do this to birds they slice them in half
they are bird blending machines
in west africa there s a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market
so what s being done well we re conducting research on these birds we re putting transmitters on them
we re trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go
we can see that they travel different countries so if you focus on a problem locally it s not going to help you
we need to work with governments in regional levels
we re working with local communities
we re talking to them about appreciating vultures about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide
how can you help you can become active make noise you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures volunteer your time to spread the word spread the word
when you walk out of this room you will be informed about vultures but speak to your families to your children to your neighbors about vultures
they are very graceful charles darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies
kenya this world will be much poorer without these wonderful species
thank you very much
when i was i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house
my father was listening to bbc news on his small gray radio
there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him
the taliban are gone my father shouted
i didn t know what it meant but i could see that my father was very very happy
you can go to a real school now he said
a morning that i will never forget
a real school
you see i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school
so for the next five years i dressed as a boy to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school
it was the only way we both could be educated
each day we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping
the school was in a house more than of us packed in one small living room
it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer
we all knew we were risking our lives the teacher the students and our parents
from time to time the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because taliban were suspicious
we always wondered what they knew about us
were we being followed
do they know where we live
we were scared but still school was where we wanted to be
i was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time
a total maverick from a remote province of afghanistan he insisted that his daughter my mom go to school and for that he was disowned by his father
but my educated mother became a teacher
there she is
she retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood
and my father that s him he was the first ever in his family to receive an education
there was no question that his children would receive an education including his daughters despite the taliban despite the risks
to him there was greater risk in not educating his children
during taliban years i remember there were times i would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future
i would want to quit but my father he would say listen my daughter you can lose everything you own in your life
your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will
so do you still not want to continue
today i am
i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war
fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school and had my family not been so committed to my education i would be one of them
instead i stand here a proud graduate of middlebury college
when i returned to afghanistan my grandfather the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters was among the first to congratulate me
he not only brags about my college degree but also that i was the first woman and that i am the first woman to drive him through the streets of kabul
my family believes in me
i dream big but my family dreams even bigger for me
that s why i am a global ambassador for x a global campaign to educate women
that s why i cofounded sola the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in afghanistan a country where it s still risky for girls to go to school
the exciting thing is that i see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity
and i see their parents and their fathers who like my own advocate for them despite and even in the face of daunting opposition
like ahmed that s not his real name and i cannot show you his face but ahmed is the father of one of my students
less than a month ago he and his daughter were on their way from sola to their village and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes
as he arrived home the phone rang a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school they would try again
kill me now if you wish he said but i will not ruin my daughter s future because of your old and backward ideas
what i ve come to realize about afghanistan and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success
it s not to say that our mothers aren t key in our success
in fact they re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters but in the context of a society like in afghanistan we must have the support of men
under the taliban girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds remember it was illegal
but today more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan
afghanistan looks so different from here in america
i find that americans see the fragility in changes
i fear that these changes will not last much beyond the you s troops withdrawal
but when i am back in afghanistan when i see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them i see a promising future and lasting change
to me afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities and every single day the girls of sola remind me of that
like me they are dreaming big
thank you
hi this is my mobile phone
a mobile phone can change your life and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom
with a mobile phone you can shoot a crime against humanity in syria
with a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in egypt
and with a mobile phone you can record a song load it up to soundcloud and become famous
all this is possible with your mobile phone
i m a child of and i live in the city of berlin
let s go back to that time to this city
here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change
this is autumn and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket
who in the room has a mobile phone with you
hold it up
hold your phones up hold your phones up
hold it up an android a blackberry wow
that s a lot almost everybody today has a mobile phone
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone and how it changed my life
and i will talk about this
these are lines of information
raw data
and why are these informations there
because in the summer of the e you commission tabled a directive
this directive is called data retention directive
this directive says that each phone company in europe each internet service company all over europe has to store a wide range of information about the users
who calls whom who sends whom an email
who sends whom a text message
and if you use your mobile phone where you are
all this information is stored for at least six months up to two years by your phone company or your internet service provider
and all over europe people stood up and said we don t want this
they said we don t want this data retention
we want self determination in the digital age and we don t want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about us
they were lawyers journalists priests they all said we don t want this
and here you can see like thousands of people went out on the streets of berlin and said freedom not fear
and some even said this would be stasi
stasi was the secret police in east germany
and i also ask myself does it really work
can they really store all this information about us
every time i use my mobile phone
so i asked my phone company deutsche telekom which was at that time the largest phone company in germany and i asked them please send me all the information you have stored about me
and i asked them once and i asked them again and i got no real answer it was only blah blah answers
but then i said i want to have this information because this is my life you are protocoling
so i decided to start a lawsuit against them because i wanted to have this information
but deutsche telekom said no we will not give you this information
so at the end i had a settlement with them
i ll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for
because in the mean time the german constitutional court ruled that the implementation of this e you directive into german law was unconstitutional
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c d inside
and on the c d this was on
thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information
at first i saw it and i said okay it s a huge file okay
but then after a while i realized this is my life
this is six months of my life into this file
so i was a little bit skeptical what should i do with it
because you can see where i am where i sleep at night what i am doing
but then i said i want to go out with this information
i want to make them public
because i want to show the people what does data retention mean
so together with zeit online and open data city i did this
this is a visualization of six months of my life
you can zoom in and zoom out you can wind back and fast forward
you can see every step i take
and you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne and how often i call in between
all this is possible with this information
that s a little bit scary
but it is not only about me
it s about all of us
first it s only like i call my wife and she calls me and we talk to each other a couple of times
and then there are some friends calling me and they call each other
and after a while you are calling you and you are calling you and you have this great communication network
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other what times they call each other when they go to bed
you can see all of this
you can see the hubs like who are the leaders in the group
if you have access to this information you can see what your society is doing
if you have access to this information you can control your society
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran
this is a blueprint how to survey your society because you know who talks to whom who sends whom an email all this is possible if you have access to this information
and this information is stored for at least six months in europe up to two years
like i said at the beginning imagine that all those people on the streets of berlin in autumn of had a mobile phone in their pocket
and the stasi would have known who took part at this protest and if the stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it this may never have happened
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not have been there
and in the aftermath also not the fall of the iron curtain
because today state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us online and offline
they want to have the possibility to track our lives and they want to store them for all time
but self determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction
but you have to fight for your self determination today
you have to fight for it every day
so when you go home tell your friends that privacy is a value of the st century and it s not outdated
when you go home tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information they don t have to do it
and if you don t believe me ask your phone company what information they store about you
so in the future every time you use your mobile phone let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self determination in the digital age
thank you
photography has been my passion ever since i was old enough to pick up a camera but today i want to share with you the most treasured photos of mine and i didn t take any of them
there were no art directors no stylists no chance for reshoots not even any regard for lighting
in fact most of them were taken by random tourists
my story begins when i was in new york city for a speaking engagement and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday we re on the corner of th and th
we happened to be back in new york exactly a year later so we decided to take the same picture
well you can see where this is going
approaching my daughter s third birthday my wife said hey why don t you take sabina back to new york and make it a father daughter trip and continue the ritual
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture
you know it s remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger
no one s ever refused and luckily no one s ever run off with our camera
back then we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives
it s really become sacred to us
this one was taken just weeks after and i found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five year old could understand
so these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment or even a specific trip
they re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in october and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year and not just physically but in every way
because while we take the same photo our perspectives change and she reaches new milestones and i get to see life through her eyes and how she interacts with and sees everything
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year
recently on one trip we were walking and she stops dead in her tracks and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five year old standing in that exact spot
she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier
and now what she s looking at in new york are colleges because she s determined to go to school in new york
and it hit me one of the most important things we all make are memories
so i want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories
i don t know about you but aside from these shots i m not in many of the family photos
i m always the one taking the picture
so i want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot and don t hesitate to go up to someone and ask will you take our picture
thank you
i have never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile son resist gaddafi fight him
but don t you ever turn into a gaddafi like revolutionary
almost two years have passed since the libyan revolution broke out inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the tunisian and the egyptian revolutions
i joined forces with many other libyans inside and outside libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of gaddafi
and there it was a great revolution
young libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime raising slogans of freedom dignity social justice
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi
they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south
eventually after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost dead we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant
however gaddafi left behind a heavy burden a legacy of tyranny corruption and seeds of diversions
for four decades gaddafi s tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of libyan society
aware of the devastation and the challenges i was keen among many other women to rebuild the libyan civil society calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation
almost organizations were established in benghazi during and immediately after the fall of gaddafi almost in tripoli
after a period of years in exile i went back to libya and with unique enthusiasm i started organizing workshops on capacity building on human development of leadership skills
with an amazing group of women i co founded the libyan women s platform for peace a movement of women leaders from different walks of life to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace
i met a very difficult environment in the pre elections an environment which was increasingly polarized an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion
i led an initiative by the libyan women s platform for peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law a law that would give every citizen no matter what your background the right to vote and run and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists creating the zipper list
eventually our initiative was adopted and successful
women won percent of the national congress in the first elections ever in years
however bit by bit the euphoria of the elections and of the revolution as a whole was fading out for every day we were waking up to the news of violence
one day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and sufi tombs
on another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the american ambassador and the attack on the consulate
on another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers
and every day every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law
our society shaped by a revolutionary mindset became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles freedom dignity social justice that we first held
intolerance exclusion and revenge became the icons of the aftermath of the revolution
i am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections
i m rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice made the wrong decision
we did not prioritize right
for elections did not bring peace and stability and security in libya
did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation
no it didn t
what is it then
why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion by both men and women
maybe what was missing was not the women only but the feminine values of compassion mercy and inclusion
our society needs national dialogue and consensus building more than it needed the elections which only reinforced polarization and division
our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical quantitative representation of the feminine
we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage
we need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy
we need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge collaboration instead of competition inclusion instead of exclusion
these are the ideals that a war torn libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace
for peace has an alchemy and this alchemy is about the intertwining the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives
that s the real zipper
and we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically
according to a quranic verse salam peace is the word of the all merciful god raheem
in turn the word raheem which is known in all abrahamic traditions has the same root in arabic as the word rahem womb symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female from which all tribes all peoples have emanated from
and so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo which grows within it the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence
thus we are told that my mercy encompasses all things
thus we are told that my mercy takes precedence over my anger
may we all be granted a grace of mercy
thank you
five years ago i experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be alice in wonderland
penn state asked me a communications teacher to teach a communications class for engineering students
and i was scared
really scared scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big unfamiliar words
but as these conversations unfolded i experienced what alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world
that s just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students i was amazed at the ideas that they had and i wanted others to experience this wonderland as well
and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication
we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world
our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges from energy to environment to health care among others and if we don t know about it and understand it then the work isn t done and i believe it s our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions
but these great conversations can t occur if our scientists and engineers don t invite us in to see their wonderland
so scientists and engineers please talk nerdy to us
i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging
first question to answer for us so what
tell us why your science is relevant to us
don t just tell me that you study trabeculae but tell me that you study trabeculae which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it s important to understanding and treating osteoporosis
and when you re describing your science beware of jargon
jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas
sure you can say spatial and temporal but why not just say space and time which is so much more accessible to us
and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down
instead as einstein said make everything as simple as possible but no simpler
you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas
a few things to consider are having examples stories and analogies those are ways to engage and excite us about your content
and when presenting your work drop the bullet points
have you ever wondered why they re called bullet points
what do bullets do bullets kill and they will kill your presentation
a slide like this is not only boring but it relies too much on the language area of our brain and causes us to become overwhelmed
instead this example slide by genevieve brown is much more effective it s showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the eiffel tower
and the trick here is to use a single readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what s being described
so i think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering
and because the engineers that i ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd i want to summarize with an equation
take your science subtract your bullet points and your jargon divide by relevance meaning share what s relevant to the audience and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you re doing and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding
and so scientists and engineers when you ve solved this equation by all means talk nerdy to me
thank you
hi my name is cameron russell and for the last little while i ve been a model
actually for years
and i feel like there s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because i should not have worn this dress
so luckily i brought an outfit change
this is the first outfit change on the ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it i think
if some of the women were really horrified when i came out you don t have to tell me now but i ll find out later on twitter
i d also note that i m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief seconds
not everybody gets to do that
these heels are very uncomfortable so good thing i wasn t going to wear them
the worst part is putting this sweater over my head because that s when you ll all laugh at me so don t do anything while it s over my head
all right
so why did i do that
that was awkward
well hopefully not as awkward as that picture
image is powerful but also image is superficial
i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds
and in this picture i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life
i was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy s hair
and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work there s very little that we can do to transform how we look and how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives
so today for me being fearless means being honest
and i am on this stage because i am a model
i am on this stage because i am a pretty white woman and in my industry we call that a sexy girl
and i m going to answer the questions that people always ask me but with an honest twist
so the first question is how do you become a model
and i always just say oh i was scouted but that means nothing
the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery and i am the recipient of a legacy and maybe you re wondering what is a legacy
well for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we re biologically programmed to admire but also as tall slender figures and femininity and white skin
and this is a legacy that was built for me and it s a legacy that i ve been cashing out on
and i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like wait naomi tyra joan smalls liu wen
and first i commend you on your model knowledge very impressive
but unfortunately i have to inform you that in a very inspired nyu ph d student counted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the models that were hired only or less than four percent were non white
the next question people always ask me is can i be a model when i grow up
and the first answer is i don t know they don t put me in charge of that
but the second answer and what i really want to say to these little girls is why
you know you can be anything
you could be the president of the united states or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja cardio thoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because you d be the first one
if after this amazing list they still are like no no cameron i want to be a model well then i say be my boss
because i m not in charge of anything and you could be the editor in chief of american vogue or the ceo of h amp amp m or the next steven meisel
saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the powerball when you grow up
it s out of your control and it s awesome and it s not a career path
i will demonstrate for you now years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardio thoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right into right now
so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there like a nice hmi and the client says cameron we want a walking shot well then this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary friends times
it will look something like this
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle
that was i don t know what happened there
unfortunately after you ve gone to school and you have a résumé and you ve done a few jobs you can t say anything anymore so if you say you want to be the president of the united states but your résumé reads underwear model years people give you a funny look
the next question people always ask me is do they retouch all the photos
and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of what s happening
this picture is the very first picture that i ever took and it s also the very first time that i had worn a bikini and i didn t even have my period yet
i know we re getting personal but i was a young girl
this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier
here s me on the same day as this shoot
my friend got to come with me
here s me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french vogue
here s me on the soccer team and in v magazine
and here s me today
and i hope what you re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me
they are constructions and they are constructions by a group of professionals by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre production and post production and they build this that s not me
okay so the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff
i do have too many inch heels which i never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that i get is the free stuff that i get in real life and that s what we don t like to talk about
i grew up in cambridge and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free
when i was a teenager i was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way
and i got these free things because of how i look not who i am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are
i live in new york and last year of the teenagers that were stopped and frisked percent of them were black and latino and most of them were young men
and there are only young black and latino men in new york so for them it s not a question of will i get stopped
but how many times will i get stopped when will i get stopped
when i was researching this talk i found out that of the year old girls in the united states percent don t like their bodies and that number goes to percent by the time that they re
so the last question people ask me is what is it like to be a model
and i think the answer that they re looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous
and when we re backstage we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that
we say it s really amazing to travel and it s amazing to get to work with creative inspired passionate people
and those things are true but they re only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that i have never said on camera is i am insecure
and i m insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day
and if you ever are wondering if i have thinner thighs and shinier hair will i be happier
you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and they re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet
so when i was writing this talk i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look i ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn t always make me happy
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries
but i m also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it s great that i got to come before or or years had passed and i d had more agency in my career because maybe then i wouldn t tell the story of how i got my first job or maybe i wouldn t tell the story of how i paid for college which seems so important right now
if there s a takeaway to this talk i hope it s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures
thank you
there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives
we don t bump into every neighbor so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on though we do share the same public spaces
so over the past few years i ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space using simple tools like stickers stencils and chalk
and these projects came from questions i had like how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments
how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other s doors at a bad time
how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings and gain a better understanding of our landscape
and how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today
now i live in new orleans and i am in love with new orleans
my soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees shading lovers drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years and i trust a city that always makes way for music
i feel like every time someone sneezes new orleans has a parade
the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in america
i live near this house and i thought about how i could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood and i also thought about something that changed my life forever
in i lost someone i loved very much
her name was joan and she was a mother to me and her death was sudden and unexpected
and i thought about death a lot and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time i ve had and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now
but i struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life
i feel like it s easy to get caught up in the day to day and forget what really matters to you
so with help from old and new friends i turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill in the blank sentence before i die i want to so anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk reflect on their lives and share their personal aspirations in public space
i didn t know what to expect from this experiment but by the next day the wall was entirely filled out and it kept growing
and i d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall
before i die i want to be tried for piracy
before i die i want to straddle the international date line
before i die i want to sing for millions
before i die i want to plant a tree
before i die i want to live off the grid
before i die i want to hold her one more time
before i die i want to be someone s cavalry
before i die i want to be completely myself
so this neglected space became a constructive one and people s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud tear up and they consoled me during my own tough times
it s about knowing you re not alone
it s about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways
it s about making space for reflection and contemplation and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change
i made this last year and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community so my civic center colleagues and i made a tool kit and now walls have been made in countries around the world including kazakhstan south africa australia argentina and beyond
together we ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people
in our age of increasing distractions it s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender
death is something that we re often discouraged to talk about or even think about but i ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do
thinking about death clarifies your life
our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community and with more ways to share our hopes fears and stories the people around us can not only help us make better places they can help us lead better lives
thank you
thank you
so well i do applied math and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math is that we are like management consultants
no one knows what the hell we do
so i am going to give you some attempt today to try and explain to you what i do
so dancing is one of the most human of activities
we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on
now ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it
now sadly neurological disorders such as parkinson s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability as it is doing to my friend jan stripling who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years
however there are million people worldwide who have the disease and they have to live with incurable weakness tremor rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it s too late
we need to be able to measure progression objectively and ultimately the only way we re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure
but frustratingly with parkinson s disease and other movement disorders there are no biomarkers so there s no simple blood test that you can do and the best that we have is like this minute neurologist test
you have to go to the clinic to do it it s very very costly and that means that outside the clinical trials it s just never done it s never done
but what if patients could do this test at home
now that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic and what if patients could do that test themselves right
no expensive staff time required
takes about by the way in the neurologist s clinic to do it
so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this because you see in one sense at least we are all virtuosos like my friend jan stripling
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds
now this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds and we all actually have the genes for it foxp for example
and like ballet it takes an extraordinary level of training
i mean just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak
from the sound we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates and just as the limbs are affected in parkinson s so too are the vocal organs
so on the bottom trace you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor
we see all the same symptoms
we see vocal tremor weakness and rigidity
the speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while and that s one of the example symptoms of it
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle in some cases but with any digital microphone and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning which is very advanced by now we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone
so these voice based tests how do they stack up against expert clinical tests we ll they re both non invasive
the neurologist s test is non invasive they both use existing infrastructure
you don t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it
and they re both accurate okay but in addition voice based tests are non expert
that means they can be self administered
they re high speed take about seconds at most
they re ultra low cost and we all know what happens
when something becomes ultra low cost it becomes massively scalable
so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients
no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup
we can do high frequency monitoring to get objective data
we can perform low cost mass recruitment for clinical trials and we can make population scale screening feasible for the first time
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it s too late
so taking the first steps towards this today we re launching the parkinson s voice initiative
with aculab and patientslikeme we re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals
we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet
anyone healthy or with parkinson s can call in cheaply and leave recordings a few cents each and i m really happy to announce that we ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours
thank you
so max by taking all these samples of let s say people you ll be able to tell who s healthy and who s not
what are you going to get out of those samples
yeah yeah so what will happen is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not you see right
you see some people may not do it they may not get through it
but we ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances and it s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors and looking for the actual markers of the disease
so you re percent accurate right now
it s much better than that
actually my student thanasis i have to plug him because he s done some fantastic work and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well which enables this project and we re getting percent accuracy
ninety nine well that s an improvement
so what that means is that people will be able to — people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test and people with parkinson s could call in record their voice and then their doctor can check up on their progress see where they re doing in this course of the disease
absolutely
thanks so much max little everybody
thanks tom
i live in south central
this is south central liquor stores fast food vacant lots
so the city planners they get together and they figure they re going to change the name south central to make it represent something else so they change it to south los angeles like this is going to fix what s really going wrong in the city
this is south los angeles
liquor stores fast food vacant lots
just like million other americans i live in a food desert south central los angeles home of the drive thru and the drive by
funny thing is the drive thrus are killing more people than the drive bys
people are dying from curable diseases in south central los angeles
for instance the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than say beverly hills which is probably eight miles away
i got tired of seeing this happening
and i was wondering how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood
i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars
i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks
and i figured this has to stop
so i figured that the problem is the solution
food is the problem and food is the solution
plus i got tired of driving minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn t impregnated with pesticides
so what i did i planted a food forest in front of my house
it was on a strip of land that we call a parkway
it s feet by feet
thing is it s owned by the city
but you have to maintain it
so i m like cool i can do whatever the hell i want since it s my responsibility and i got to maintain it
and this is how i decided to maintain it
so me and my group l a green grounds we got together and we started planting my food forest fruit trees you know the whole nine vegetables
what we do we re a pay it forward kind of group where it s composed of gardeners from all walks of life from all over the city and it s completely volunteer and everything we do is free
and the garden it was beautiful
and then somebody complained
the city came down on me and basically gave me a citation saying that i had to remove my garden which this citation was turning into a warrant
and i m like come on really
a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about
and i was like cool bring it
because this time it wasn t coming up
so l a times got ahold of it steve lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman and one of the green grounds members they put up a petition on change org and with signatures we were a success
we had a victory on our hands
my councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we re doing
i mean come on why wouldn t they
l a leads the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns
they own square miles of vacant lots
that s central parks
that s enough space to plant million tomato plants
why in the hell would they not okay this
growing one plant will give you seeds
when one dollar s worth of green beans will give you dollars worth of produce
it s my gospel when i m telling people grow your own food
growing your own food is like printing your own money
see i have a legacy in south central
i grew up there i raised my sons there
and i refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people and i m manufacturing my own reality
see i m an artist
gardening is my graffiti i grow my art
just like a graffiti artist where they beautify walls me i beautiful lawns parkways
i use the garden the soil like it s a piece of cloth and the plants and the trees that s my embellishment for that cloth
you d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas
you just couldn t imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people
so what happened
i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood
to change the community you have to change the composition of the soil
we are the soil
you d be surprised how kids are affected by this
gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do especially in the inner city
plus you get strawberries
i remember this time there was this mother and a daughter came it was like at night and they were in my yard and i came out and they looked so ashamed
so i m like man it made me feel bad that they were there and i told them you know you don t have to do this like this
this is on the street for a reason
it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry and this only reinforced why i do this and people asked me fin aren t you afraid people are going to steal your food
and i m like hell no i ain t afraid they re going to steal it
that s why it s on the street
that s the whole idea
i want them to take it but at the same time i want them to take back their health
there s another time when i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles
these are the guys they helped me unload the truck
it was cool and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother and it was just cool to see how this changed them if it was only for that one moment
so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe gardens
we ve had like people come to our dig ins and participate and it s all volunteers
if kids grow kale kids eat kale
if they grow tomatoes they eat tomatoes
but when none of this is presented to them if they re not shown how food affects the mind and the body they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them
i see young people and they want to work but they re in this thing where they re caught up i see kids of color and they re just on this track that s designed for them that leads them to nowhere
so with gardening i see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities to have a sustainable life
and when we do this who knows
we might produce the next george washington carver
but if we don t change the composition of the soil we will never do this
now this is one of my plans this is what i want to do
i want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block
i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes
now don t get me wrong
i m not talking about no free shit because free is not sustainable
the funny thing about sustainability you have to sustain it
what i m talking about is putting people to work and getting kids off the street and letting them know the joy the pride and the honor in growing your own food opening farmer s markets
so what i want to do here we got to make this sexy
so i want us all to become ecolutionary renegades gangstas gangsta gardeners
we got to flip the script on what a gangsta is
if you ain t a gardener you ain t gangsta
get gangsta with your shovel okay
and let that be your weapon of choice
so basically if you want to meet with me you know if you want to meet don t call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit where you talk about doing some shit
if you want to meet with me come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit
peace thank you
thank you
this is where i live i live in kenya at the south parts of the nairobi national park
those are my dad s cows at the back and behind the cows that s the nairobi national park
nairobi national park is not fenced in the south widely which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely
so predators like lions follow them and this is what they do
they kill our livestock
this is one of the cows which was killed at night and i just woke up in the morning and i found it dead and i felt so bad because it was the only bull we had
my community the maasai we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them and that s why we value them so much
so i grew up hating lions so much
the morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock and they re also upset about this problem
so they kill the lions
it s one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi
and i think this is why the nairobi national park lions are few
so a boy from six to nine years old in my community is responsible for his dad s cows and that s the same thing which happened to me
so i had to find a way of solving this problem
and the first idea i got was to use fire because i thought lions were scared of fire
but i came to realize that that didn t really help because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed
so i didn t give up i continued
and a second idea i got was to use a scarecrow
i was trying to trick the lions into thinking that i was standing near the cowshed
but lions are very clever
they will come the first day and they see the scarecrow and they go back but the second day they ll come and they say this thing is not moving here it s always here
so he jumps in and kills the animals
so one night i was walking around the cowshed with a torch and that day the lions didn t come
and i discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light
so i had an idea
since i was a small boy i used to work in my room for the whole day and i even took apart my mom s new radio and that day she almost killed me but i learned a lot about electronics
so i got an old car battery an indicator box it s a small device found in a motorcycle and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left it blinks
and i got a switch where i can switch on the lights on and off
and that s a small torch from a broken flashlight
so i set up everything
as you can see the solar panel charges the battery and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box i call it a transformer
and the indicator box makes the lights flash
as you can see the bulbs face outside because that s where the lions come from
and that s how it looks to lions when they come at night
the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking i was walking around the cowshed but i was sleeping in my bed
thanks
so i set it up in my home two years ago and since then we have never experienced any problem with lions
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea
one of them was this grandmother
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions and she asked me if i could put the lights for her
and i said yes
so i put the lights you can see at the back those are the lion lights
since now i ve set up seven homes around my community and they re really working
and my idea is also being used now all over kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas leopards and it s also being used to scare elephants away from people s farms
because of this invention i was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in kenya brookhouse international school and i m really excited about this
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness
i even took my friends back to my community and we re installing the lights to the homes which don t have any and i m teaching them how to put them
so one year ago i was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father s cows and i used to see planes flying over and i told myself that one day i ll be there inside
and here i am today
i got a chance to come by plane for my first time for ted
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when i grow up
i used to hate lions but now because my invention is saving my father s cows and the lions we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict
ashê oldên it means in my language thank you very much
you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours
so you got this scholarship yep
you re working on other electrical inventions
what s the next one on your list
my next invention is i want to make an electric fence electric fence
but i know electric fences are already invented but i want to make mine
you already tried it once right and you i tried it before but i stopped because it gave me a shock
in the trenches richard turere you are something else
we re going to cheer you on every step of the way my friend
thank you so much thank you
everything i do and everything i do professionally my life has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in africa
from to i look young but i m not — i worked in zambia kenya ivory coast algeria somalia in projects of technical cooperation with african countries
i worked for an italian ngo and every single project that we set up in africa failed
and i was distraught
i thought age that we italians were good people and we were doing good work in africa
instead everything we touched we killed
our first project the one that has inspired my first book ripples from the zambezi was a project where we italians decided to teach zambian people how to grow food
so we arrived there with italian seeds in southern zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the zambezi river and we taught the local people how to grow italian tomatoes and zucchini and
and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that so we paid them to come and work and sometimes they would show up
and we were amazed that the local people in such a fertile valley would not have any agriculture
but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything we simply said thank god we re here
just in the nick of time to save the zambian people from starvation
and of course everything in africa grew beautifully
we had these magnificent tomatoes in italy a tomato would grow to this size in zambia to this size
and we could not believe and we were telling the zambians look how easy agriculture is
when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red overnight some hippos came out from the river and they ate everything
and we said to the zambians my god the hippos
and the zambians said yes that s why we have no agriculture here
why didn t you tell us you never asked
i thought it was only us italians blundering around africa but then i saw what the americans were doing what the english were doing what the french were doing and after seeing what they were doing i became quite proud of our project in zambia
because you see at least we fed the hippos
you should see the rubbish — you should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting african people
you want to read the book read dead aid by dambisa moyo zambian woman economist
the book was published in
we western donor countries have given the african continent two trillion american dollars in the last years
i m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done
just go and read her book
read it from an african woman the damage that we have done
we western people are imperialist colonialist missionaries and there are only two ways we deal with people we either patronize them or we are paternalistic
the two words come from the latin root pater which means father
but they mean two different things
paternalistic i treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children i love you so much
patronizing i treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants
that s why the white people in africa are called bwana boss
i was given a slap in the face reading a book small is beautiful written by schumacher who said above all in economic development if people do not wish to be helped leave them alone
this should be the first principle of aid
the first principle of aid is respect
this morning the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor and said can we can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial
i decided when i was years old to only respond to people and i invented a system called enterprise facilitation where you never initiate anything you never motivate anybody but you become a servant of the local passion the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person
so what you do you shut up
you never arrive in a community with any ideas and you sit with the local people
we don t work from offices
we meet at the cafe we meet at the pub
we have zero infrastructure
and what we do we become friends and we find out what that person wants to do
the most important thing is passion
you can give somebody an idea
if that person doesn t want to do it what are you going to do
the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing
the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge but the knowledge is available
so years and years ago i had this idea why don t we for once instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do why don t for once listen to them but not in community meetings
let me tell you a secret
there is a problem with community meetings
entrepreneurs never come and they never tell you in a public meeting what they want to do with their own money what opportunity they have identified
so planning has this blind spot
the smartest people in your community you don t even know because they don t come to your public meetings
what we do we work one on one and to work one on one you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn t exist
you have to create a new profession
the profession is the family doctor of enterprise the family doctor of business who sits with you in your house at your kitchen table at the cafe and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living
i started this as a tryout in esperance in western australia
i was a doing a ph d at the time trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do
and so what i did in esperance that first year was to just walk the streets and in three days i had my first client and i helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage was a maori guy and i helped him to sell to the restaurant in perth to get organized and then the fishermen came to me to say you the guy who helped maori can you help us
and i helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in albany for cents a kilo but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to japan for dollars a kilo and the farmers came to talk to me said hey you helped them can you help us
in a year i had projects going on and the government came to see me to say how can you do that
how can you do — and i said i do something very very very difficult
i shut up and listen to them
so — — so the government says do it again
we ve done it in communities around the world
we have helped to start businesses
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude
peter drucker one of the greatest management consultants in history died age a few years ago
peter drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business and this is what peter drucker says planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy
planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship
so now you re rebuilding christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy
you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you
you have to offer them confidentiality privacy you have to be fantastic at helping them and then they will come and they will come in droves
in a community of people we get clients
can you imagine a community of people the intelligence and the passion
which presentation have you applauded the most this morning
local passionate people that s who you have applauded
so what i m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it s at
we are at the end of the first industrial revolution nonrenewable fossil fuels manufacturing and all of a sudden we have systems which are not sustainable
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable
freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable
what we have to look at is at how we feed cure educate transport communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way
the technologies do not exist to do that
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution universities forget about it
government forget about it
it will be entrepreneurs and they re doing it now
there s a lovely story that i read in a futurist magazine many many years ago
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in
and in this group of people came together and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of new york in years and the conclusion was unanimous the city of new york would not exist in years
why because they looked at the curve and said if the population keeps growing at this rate to move the population of new york around they would have needed six million horses and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with
they were already drowning in manure
so they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of new york
so what happens in years time in the year in the united states of america there were car manufacturing companies
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over and there were tiny tiny little factories in backwaters
dearborn michigan henry ford
however there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs
first you have to offer them confidentiality
otherwise they don t come and talk to you
then you have to offer them absolute dedicated passionate service to them
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship
the smallest company the biggest company has to be capable of doing three things beautifully the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic you have to have fantastic marketing and you have to have tremendous financial management
guess what
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it sell it and look after the money
it doesn t exist
this person has never been born
we ve done the research and we have looked at the iconic companies of the world carnegie westinghouse edison ford all the new companies google yahoo
there s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common only one none were started by one person
now we teach entrepreneurship to year olds in northumberland and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of richard branson s autobiography and the task of the year olds is to underline in the first two pages of richard branson s autobiography how many times richard uses the word i and how many times he uses the word we
never the word i and the word we times
he wasn t alone when he started
nobody started a company alone no one
so we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes in bars and your dedicated buddies who will do to you what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic somebody who will say to you what do you need
what can you do can you make it
okay can you sell it can you look after the money
oh no i cannot do this would you like me to find you somebody
we activate communities
we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion the energy and imagination of your own people
thank you
before march i was a photographic retoucher based in new york city
we re pale gray creatures
we hide in dark windowless rooms and generally avoid sunlight
we make skinny models skinnier perfect skin more perfect and the impossible possible and we get criticized in the press all the time but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography
on march i watched from home as the rest of the world did as the tragic events unfolded in japan
soon after an organization i volunteer with all hands volunteers were on the ground within days working as part of the response efforts
i along with hundreds of other volunteers knew we couldn t just sit at home so i decided to join them for three weeks
on may the th i made my way to the town of ōfunato
it s a small fishing town in iwate prefecture about people one of the first that was hit by the wave
the waters here have been recorded at reaching over meters in height and traveled over two miles inland
as you can imagine the town had been devastated
we pulled debris from canals and ditches
we cleaned schools we de mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation
we cleared tons and tons of stinking rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant
we got dirty and we loved it
for weeks all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things
they d been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and sd cards
and everyone was doing the same
they were collecting them up and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping
now it wasn t until this point that i realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt
as they had run from the wave and for their lives absolutely everything they had everything had to be left behind
at the end of my first week there i found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town
i was helping clean the onsen the communal onsen the huge giant bathtubs
this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos
this is where people were handing them in and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand cleaning them
now it was emotional and it was inspiring and i ve always heard about thinking outside the box but it wasn t until i had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened
as i looked through the photos there were some were over a hundred years old some still in the envelope from the processing lab i couldn t help but think as a retoucher that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch and i knew hundreds of people who could do the same
so that evening i just reached out on facebook and asked a few of them and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive i knew we had to give it a go
so we started retouching photos
this was the very first
not terribly damaged but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl s face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy
otherwise that little girl isn t going to look like that little girl anymore and surely that s as tragic as having the photo damaged
over time more photos came in thankfully and more retouchers were needed and so i reached out again on facebook and linkedin and within five days people wanted to help from different countries
within two weeks i had people wanting to join in
within japan by july we d branched out to the neighboring town of rikuzentakata further north to a town called yamada
once a week we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up where people were reclaiming their photos
the older ladies sometimes hadn t seen a scanner before but within minutes of them finding their lost photo they could give it to us have it scanned uploaded to a cloud server it would be downloaded by a gaijin a stranger somewhere on the other side of the globe and it d start being fixed
the time it took however to get it back is a completely different story and it depended obviously on the damage involved
it could take an hour it could take weeks
it could take months
the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand drawn or pieced together picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn t damaged
it was very time consuming
now all these photos had been damaged by water submerged in salt water covered in bacteria in sewage sometimes even in oil all of which over time is going to continue to damage them so hand cleaning them was a huge part of the project
we couldn t retouch the photo unless it was cleaned dry and reclaimed
now we were lucky with our hand cleaning
we had an amazing local woman who guided us
it s very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos
as my team leader wynne once said it s like doing a tattoo on someone
you don t get a chance to mess it up
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky as far as the photos go
she had started hand cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage
she also had duplicates
areas like her husband and her face which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix we could just put them together in one good photo and remake the whole photo
when she collected the photos from us she shared a bit of her story with us
her photos were found by her husband s colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood and they d recognized him
the day of the tsunami he d actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed
he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded
her two little boys not so little anymore but her two boys were both at school separate schools
one of them got caught up in the water
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived
the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son s th birthday
for her despite all of this those photos were the perfect gift back to him something he could look at again something he remembered from before that wasn t still scarred from that day in march when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed
after six months in japan volunteers had passed through all hands hundreds of whom had helped us hand clean over photographs the large majority a large majority of which did actually find their home again importantly
over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get families hundreds of photographs back fully restored and retouched
during this time we hadn t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials most of which was printer inks
we take photos constantly
a photo is a reminder of someone or something a place a relationship a loved one
they re our memory keepers and our histories the last thing we would grab and the first thing you d go back to look for
that s all this project was about about restoring those little bits of humanity giving someone that connection back
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it
the project s also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers
for some of them it s given them a connection to something bigger giving something back using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin
i would like to conclude by reading an email i got from one of them cindy the day i finally got back from japan after six months
as i worked i couldn t help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images
one in particular a photo of women of all ages from grandmother to little girl gathered around a baby struck a chord because a similar photo from my family my grandmother and mother myself and newborn daughter hangs on our wall
across the globe throughout the ages our basic needs are just the same aren t they
thank you
i m feet down an illegal mine shaft in ghana
the air is thick with heat and dust and it s hard to breathe
i can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness but i can t see much else
i hear voices talking but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing and stone being broken with primitive tools
like the others i wear a flickering cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic tattered band and i can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth
when my hand slips i suddenly remember a miner i had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft
as i stand talking to you today these men are still deep in that hole risking their lives without payment or compensation and often dying
i got to climb out of that hole and i got to go home but they likely never will because they re trapped in slavery
for the last years i ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than countries on six continents and in i had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the vancouver peace summit
amongst all the astonishing people i met there i met a supporter of free the slaves an ngo dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery
we started talking about slavery and really i started learning about slavery for i had certainly known it existed in the world but not to such a degree
after we finished talking i felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime and i thought if i don t know how many other people don t know
it started burning a hole in my stomach so within weeks i flew down to los angeles to meet with the director of free the slaves and offer them my help
thus began my journey into modern day slavery
oddly i had been to many of these places before
some i even considered like my second home
but this time i would see the skeletons hidden in the closet
a conservative estimate tells us there are more than million people enslaved in the world today
that s double the amount of people taken from africa during the entire trans atlantic slave trade
a hundred and fifty years ago an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an american worker
that equates to about in today s money
yet today entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as
astonishingly slavery generates profits of more than billion worldwide each year
many have been tricked by false promises of a good education a better job only to find that they re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence and they cannot walk away
today s slavery is about commerce so the goods that enslaved people produce have value but the people producing them are disposable
slavery exists everywhere nearly in the world and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world
in india and nepal i was introduced to the brick kilns
this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient egypt or dante s inferno
enveloped in temperatures of degrees men women children entire families in fact were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust while mechanically stacking bricks on their head up to at a time and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away
deadened by monotony and exhaustion they work silently doing this task over and over for or hours a day
there were no breaks for food no water breaks and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential
so pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working
every minutes i d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it and as i sat there i thought my camera is getting far better treatment than these people
back in the kilns i wanted to cry but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said lisa don t do that just don t do that here
and he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this not just for me but for them
i couldn t offer them any direct help
i couldn t give them money nothing
i wasn t a citizen of that country
i could get them in a worse situation than they were already in
i d have to rely on free the slaves to work within the system for their liberation and i trusted that they would
as for me i d have to wait until i got home to really feel my heartbreak
in the himalayas i found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below
the big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth
it s difficult to witness something so overwhelming
how can we affect something so insidious yet so pervasive
some don t even know they re enslaved people working hours a day without any pay because this has been the case all their lives
they have nothing to compare it to
when these villagers claimed their freedom the slaveholders burned down all of their houses
i mean these people had nothing and they were so petrified they wanted to give up but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own so that now they do the same back breaking work but they do it for themselves and they get paid for it and they do it in freedom
sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery and because of this worldwide awareness i was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry
in kathmandu i was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves
they ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty dimly fluorescent lit basement
this wasn t a brothel per se
it was more like a restaurant
cabin restaurants as they re known in the trade are venues for forced prostitution
each has small private rooms where the slaves women along with young girls and boys some as young as seven years old are forced to entertain the clients encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol
each cubicle is dark and dingy identified with a painted number on the wall and partitioned by plywood and a curtain
the workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers
standing in the near darkness i remember feeling this quick hot fear and in that instant i could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell
i had only one way out the stairs from where i d come in
there were no back doors
there were no windows large enough to climb through
these people have no escape at all and as we take in such a difficult subject it s important to note that slavery including sex trafficking occurs in our own backyard as well
tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture in restaurants in domestic servitude and the list can go on
recently the new york times reported that between and american children are sold into sex slavery every year
it s all around us we just don t see it
the textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor
i visited villages in india where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade
this is a family portrait
the dyed black hands are the father while the blue and red hands are his sons
they mix dye in these big barrels and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows but the dye is toxic
my interpreter told me their stories
we have no freedom they said
we hope still though that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing
it s estimated that more than children are enslaved on lake volta the largest man made lake in the world
when we first arrived i went to have a quick look
i saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat two older brothers some younger kids makes sense right
wrong they were all enslaved
children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished and they re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake even though they do not know how to swim
this young child is eight years old
he was trembling when our boat approached frightened it would run over his tiny canoe
he was petrified he would be knocked in the water
the skeletal tree limbs submerged in lake volta often catch the fishing nets and weary frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines
many of them drown
for as long as he can recall he s been forced to work on the lake
terrified of his master he will not run away and since he s been treated with cruelty all his life he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages
i met these boys at five in the morning when they were hauling in the last of their nets but they had been working since a m
in the cold windy night
and it s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they re full of fish
i want to introduce you to kofi
kofi was rescued from a fishing village
i met him at a shelter where free the slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery
here he s seen taking a bath at the well pouring big buckets of water over his head and the wonderful news is as you and i are sitting here talking today kofi has been reunited with his family and what s even better his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe
kofi is the embodiment of possibility
who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life
driving down a road in ghana with partners of free the slaves a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window
he told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle
at the end of the road he urged us out of the car and told the driver to quickly leave
then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath and said this is the path this is the path go
as we started down the path we pushed aside the vines blocking the way and after about an hour of walking in found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains so i hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest
after another two hours of hiking the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring
many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold wading in water poisoned by mercury
mercury is used in the extraction process
these miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of ghana
when they came out of the shaft they were soaking wet from their own sweat
i remember looking into their tired bloodshot eyes for many of them had been underground for hours
the shafts are up to feet deep and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold
at first glance the pounding site seems full of powerful men but when we look closer we see some less fortunate working on the fringes and children too
all of them are victim to injury illness and violence
in fact it s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years
this is manuru when his father died his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines
when his uncle died manuru inherited his uncle s debt which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines
when i met him he had been working in the mines for years and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated
on top of that manuru has tuberculosis yet he s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft
even still he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like free the slaves and it s this sort of determination in the face of unimaginable odds that fills me with complete awe
i want to shine a light on slavery
when i was working in the field i brought lots of candles with me and with the help of my interpreter i imparted to the people i was photographing that i wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight so when it was safe for them and safe for me i made these images
they knew their image would be seen by you out in the world
i wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives
i truly believe if we can see one another as fellow human beings then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery
these images are not of issues they are of people real people like you and me all deserving of the same rights dignity and respect in their lives
there is not a day that goes by that i don t think of these many beautiful mistreated people i ve had the tremendous honor of meeting
i hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them people like you and i hope that force will ignite a fire and that fire will shine a light on slavery for without that light the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows
thank you very much
