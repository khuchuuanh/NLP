gives an insightful and rewarding performance director lajos koltai states in the dvd extras that he sought out glenn close to play the relatively small part of lila s mother ecause he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film he certainly was right and close s performance in that one scene etches it in your mind all the other scenes in which close is lila s very proper mother and you get another performance to treasure there are three other scenes in the film com ined with the one featuring close descri ed a ove that make the whole movie worth watching

fifty years later when lila comes and crawls into ed with her dying friend ann to talk a out the lives they have lived in this latter scene streep and redgrave are enthralling the other memora le

james picks a gay one they get a trip to new zealand and if he picks a straight one straight guy gets 25 000 how can this not e fun take my hand let us stroll the most glaring pro lem with this show is the achelor himself james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and ody the one you would pro a ly give two glances towards at your local ar efore grazing for greener pastures why they chose to cast james as the leading man is eyond me god knows there s so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to e on tv aside from his rather average physical appearance james is a out as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk even as such he has this arrogant smugly condescending aura a out him however if james were standing up against a lank white wall he would meld right into in it i honestly can t recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing james said during the course of the show he is that oring and forgetta le in fact one of the mates flat out advised him he wasn t feeling a connection i thought that was the est part of the show also james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt sound feminine or sound masculine ut don t ing segue tones in the middle of sentences so painful to sit through i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hag then we have the suitors a remarka ly land unch of men who don t seem to care either way what is happening equally vapid they seem to e indistinguisha le from one guy to the next except hey that guy has lond highlights or oh that one has curly hair again astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to e the aim of this show while it may e hackneyed to type cast roles it would ve een a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones however in all their anality they still manage to upstage james which isn t all that hard to do anyway slightly that is you know you have a pro lem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man very sad also i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message oards which i felt was actually true the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys don t get me wrong i am not saying all the gay guys were ugly and oring as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute it s just that overall they were just blah compared to the men you would see on shows like a shot at love with tila tequila or the bachelorette i don t know how many times i hit fast forward during this show i can accept a lead character as interesting as a card oard ox i can accept the mundane apathetic suitors ut please for the love of god entertain me just a little no such luck if you are expecting drama intrigue sexiness or excitement you will e severely disappointed the iggest drama comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a oyfriend in new york how scandalous as titillating as that may e i guarantee you that is the only thing that remotely resem les any conflict on this show sure there is the twist ut if you have any sem lance of gaydar in you you will easily discern who s who it wasn t hard at all i was only wrong once this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else we get to watch as james co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance shopping for gifts visiting a petting zoo and gay karaoke yawn sure you have the occasional topless dancing ut who cares when everyone is oring anyway that s one of main pro lems with the show no one seems to e enjoying themselves they are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time and you really cannot lame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame
